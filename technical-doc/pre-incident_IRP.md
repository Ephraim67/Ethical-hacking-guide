To leverage the pre-incident preparation concepts from the Mosse Institute article in creating a solid **Incident Response Plan (IRP)**, you need to turn those preparations into structured, actionable components of your plan. 


### 1. **Align Incident Response Plan with Business Requirements**

**Action:**

* Conduct a **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**.
* Identify critical assets, systems, and data (e.g., customer databases, intellectual property, finance systems).
* Map potential threats to those assets.

**In the IRP:**

* Prioritize incidents based on impact to business functions.
* Define escalation paths based on asset sensitivity or criticality.

### 2. **Define and Train Your In-House Incident Response Team (IRT)**

**Action:**

* Assign roles: incident commander, analyst, containment lead, communications officer, etc.
* Develop skill requirements and training schedules.
* Run tabletop exercises and simulations.

**In the IRP:**

* Include a contact list and org chart of the IRT.
* Document roles, responsibilities, and authority levels.
* Include training and drill frequencies.

### 3. **Build and Document Technical Capabilities**

**Action:**

* Develop an **Incident Response Toolkit** (forensic software, log aggregators, network sniffers).
* Ensure **centralized logging and monitoring** is in place.
* Automate detection and alerting where possible.

**In the IRP:**

* List the tools and systems used during different incident stages (detection, analysis, containment).
* Include procedures for log retrieval, evidence preservation, and analysis.

### 4. **Map Your Infrastructure**

**Action:**

* Maintain updated network and asset inventories.
* Tag critical systems and data flows.
* Document physical and cloud environment maps.

**In the IRP:**

* Reference diagrams and inventories to support scoping and containment.
* Include procedures for isolating or accessing key systems quickly during incidents.

### 5. **Develop Specific Playbooks**

**Action:**

* Create scenario-based playbooks (e.g., ransomware, phishing, insider threat, data breach).
* Define step-by-step containment, eradication, and recovery processes.

**In the IRP:**

* Include these playbooks as appendices or linked documents.
* Ensure each playbook includes decision points, communication steps, and recovery milestones.

---

### 6. **Incorporate Communication and Legal Steps**

**Action:**

* Identify regulatory reporting requirements.
* Prepare communication templates for internal and external stakeholders.
* Liaise with legal and compliance teams.

**In the IRP:**

* Define breach notification timelines and responsibilities.
* Include contact lists for legal, PR, and law enforcement.
