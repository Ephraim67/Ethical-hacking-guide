### 3. Prepare Infrastructure to Assist in Incident Response

Implementing robust logging mechanisms is vital. Logs serve as the foundation for digital forensics, helping to:([library.mosse-institute.com][1])

* Identify events leading up to an incident.
* Determine unauthorized access or data breaches.
* Analyze system behavior during incidents.([Check Point Software][2])

Ensuring that logging is enabled across relevant systems enhances the ability to respond effectively.
