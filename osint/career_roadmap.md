### 🛡️ 1. **Junior Penetration Tester / Ethical Hacker**

* **Why?** The book covers buffer overflows, format string exploits, shellcode, and network attacks — all core offensive techniques used in real-world penetration testing.
* **Bonus if you know:** Kali Linux, Burp Suite, Metasploit, or have a CEH/OSCP cert.

---

### 💻 2. **Security Researcher (Entry-Level)**

* **Why?** Deep understanding of memory, CPU, assembly, and system calls lets you discover and analyze zero-day vulnerabilities or write PoCs (proof of concept).
* **Bonus:** If you can reverse engineer with GDB or IDA/Ghidra.

---

### 🧪 3. **Malware Analyst / Reverse Engineer (Beginner-Level)**

* **Why?** You’ll understand how shellcode and system-level exploitation works, which is foundational to analyzing malware behavior.
* **Tools to learn:** Ghidra, x64dbg, OllyDbg, Cuckoo Sandbox.

---

### 🌐 4. **Network Security Analyst / SOC Analyst (Level 1)**

* **Why?** The networking and sniffing sections teach TCP/IP, OSI layers, DoS attacks, port scanning, and hijacking techniques.
* **This role often includes:** IDS/IPS monitoring, log analysis, incident response.

---

### 🧰 5. **Exploit Developer (Junior-Level)**

* **Why?** You’ll be able to write your own exploits from scratch using buffer overflows, shellcode, and memory corruption bugs.
* **You’ll stand out if:** You understand how to bypass protections like DEP, ASLR, and non-exec stacks.

---

### 🔐 6. **CTF Competitor or Bug Bounty Hunter**

* **Why?** Almost everything in the book maps directly to real Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and bug bounty exploitation (especially on platforms like HackTheBox or TryHackMe).
* **Earn while you learn:** Some bug bounty programs pay for valid vulnerabilities found.

---

### 📊 7. **Vulnerability Assessment Analyst**

* **Why?** Knowing how exploits are crafted helps you understand what to look for during vulnerability scans and how to interpret the results accurately.
* **Good add-ons:** Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys.

---

## 🔧 Suggested Tools to Learn Alongside:

* GDB, pwndbg
* Metasploit
* Nmap, Wireshark
* Netcat
* Python or Bash scripting for automation

---

### 🎯 Pro Tips:

* Start building a **portfolio**: write blog posts or GitHub repos showing exploit walkthroughs, CTF write-ups, or code samples.
* Practice on platforms like **HackTheBox**, **TryHackMe**, **VulnHub**, or **OverTheWire**.
* Aim for certifications like **eJPT**, **CEH**, or **OSCP** once you're confident.
