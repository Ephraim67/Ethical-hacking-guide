To build yourself for the Incident Response and Monitoring + Security Engineering role you described (split roughly 60% IR and 40% engineering), here’s a structured self-development project plan that spans real-world labs, certifications, documentation exercises, and tooling exposure—aligned directly with the tasks and technologies listed.

## **1. Core Project Title: "Enterprise Threat Detection & Response Lab"**

This is a home lab and documentation-based initiative that simulates a real-world SOC/IR environment using Microsoft security tools (Sentinel, Defender, Intune), cloud security policies, and incident response playbooks.


## **Phase 1: Incident Response & Monitoring (60%)**

### **Project: Build a Cloud-based Incident Detection and Response Lab**

#### 1. **Deploy Microsoft Sentinel**

* Spin up a free-tier Azure environment.
* Connect Microsoft Sentinel to:

  * Microsoft 365 Defender
  * Azure AD (Entra ID)
  * Log analytics workspace
* **Create custom KQL queries** to detect login anomalies, malicious scripts, suspicious PowerShell usage, etc.
* Build & document **3 custom analytics rules** with alert tuning.

#### 2. **EDR Simulation with Defender**

* Use **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)** on a VM.
* Simulate attacks using:

  * Atomic Red Team
  * Caldera
  * Metasploit (controlled testing)
* Collect telemetry and run an investigation in Microsoft 365 Defender.

#### 3. **GreyMatter Simulation**

* While GreyMatter is commercial, simulate MDR processes using open-source tools:

  * Use **Wazuh** or **Security Onion** for MDR-like triaging and alerting.
  * Integrate with Azure Sentinel via syslog.

#### 4. **Create a Full Incident Timeline**

* Document a simulated ransomware/phishing attack.
* Include:

  * Timeline
  * Alerts triggered
  * Root cause analysis
  * Containment steps
  * Recovery actions



## **Phase 2: Security Engineering & Policy (40%)**

###  **Project: Enforce and Validate Secure System Configuration**

#### 1. **Configure Intune and GPO Security Baselines**

* Set up Intune and build policies:

  * BitLocker
  * Application Control
  * Defender Antivirus configuration
* Configure legacy GPO for on-prem endpoints.
* Validate policy application using **Test VMs (Win10/11)**.

#### 2. **Conditional Access & RBAC in Entra ID**

* Design & implement:

  * MFA policy
  * Blocking legacy auth
  * CA based on device compliance/location
* RBAC setup for:

  * Helpdesk
  * Admin
  * Read-only auditor
* Document policy logic and test enforcement.

#### 3. **Translate NIST / HIPAA to Technical Controls**

* Pick 5 NIST CSF or HIPAA rules and convert each to:

  * Policy applied (GPO/Intune/Defender/Conditional Access)
  * How it’s monitored
  * Enforcement validation
* E.g., “Access control – restrict admin rights” → Intune role config, Defender alerts.

#### 4. **Develop Documentation & Runbooks**

* Write SOPs:

  * Incident triage playbook
  * Endpoint hardening guide
  * Access request and de-provisioning process
* Include screenshots, logs, and validation outputs.


##  **Certifications to Support the Role**

| Certification                                     | Why It's Relevant                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **SC-200**: Microsoft Security Operations Analyst | Directly maps to Sentinel, Defender, incident triage |
| **SC-300**: Identity and Access Administrator     | Entra ID, RBAC, Conditional Access                   |
| **SC-100**: Cybersecurity Architect               | Strategic policy and engineering design              |
| **CySA+ or GCIA**                                 | Incident response & detection tooling                |
