The **OSI Model** (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how different networking systems communicate over a network. It was developed by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**.

# What It Is
The OSI Model provides a **layered approach** to network communication, where each layer handles a specific aspect of data transmission. It helps guide product developers and facilitates interoperability between different hardware and software systems.


# How Many Layers It Has
The OSI Model has **seven layers**, from top to bottom:

1. **Application**
2. **Presentation**
3. **Session**
4. **Transport**
5. **Network**
6. **Data Link**
7. **Physical**


# How It Is Organized
The OSI Model is organized **top-down** for data transmission from sender to receiver and **bottom-up** for data reception:

| Layer | Function | Key Examples |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **7. Application** | User interface for network services | Web browsers, FTP clients |
| **6. Presentation** | Data translation, encryption, compression | SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII |
| **5. Session** | Establishes and manages sessions | NetBIOS, RPC |
| **4. Transport** | Reliable data transfer, error recovery | TCP, UDP |
| **3. Network** | Logical addressing and routing | IP, ICMP |
| **2. Data Link** | Physical addressing and error detection | MAC, Ethernet, PPP |
| **1. Physical** | Transmits raw bit stream over media | Cables, hubs, fiber optics |
